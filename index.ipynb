    "We have gotten pretty good at storing our instance objects and retrieving them using class variables and class methods. We've also basically mastered how to return our instance and class data in all kinds of fun ways and formats. So, now we are going to practice separating these two jobs. If we think about it, we will probably want to re-use a lot of these query methods like `sort_by` or `find_by` on more than just one class. So, instead of creating the same methods in multiple classes, we can define another class, `Query`, which will hold all these query methods and help clean up our other classes. Let's get started!"

We also need the person class to keep track of all the people, or person instance objects as we like to call them.

By defining a Query class that operates on our other class(es), we were able to make our code cleaner and [D.R.Y.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)er. We can define our query methods in the Query class and import them into any other class we'd like instead of defining the same methods in each class we make. Great work! Feel free to continue practicing by defining other classes more methods to use with the Query class."
